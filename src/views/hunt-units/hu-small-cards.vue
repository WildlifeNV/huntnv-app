          There is a small hospital in Cedarville, California. Fuel, food, vehicle repair facilities, and motels are available in Cedarville and Gerlach. There are no developed campgrounds. Hunters typically take advantage of tree cover and or perennial water sources adjacent to the area that they are hunting. Tent-type camps are recommended. Trailer or RV-type hunters are confined to better road systems in the valley floors and are required to travel farther each day to reach their hunt area. In most cases, drinking water must be hauled from home or the nearest town.
